### Analysis of Liquor Sales Data in Iowa
#### 🔍Project Overview：
A data analysis project using public liquor sales data from the state of Iowa, with the goal of uncovering trends in consumer behavior, seasonal patterns, and store performance.<br>
#### 🛠 My Role & Contribution：
- Designed and implemented data pipelines for geospatial and time-series analysis, including identifying top-selling counties and seasonal peaks. <br>
- Created interactive visualizations and dashboards in Tableau to reveal insights across store locations, product categories, and time trends.<br>

#### ⚠️Key Challenges：
- Data Integration Across Diverse Sources<br>Faced challenges combining big data frameworks (Spark) with traditional tools (GeoPandas); resolved by downsampling, format conversion, and staged processing across environments.<br>
- Temporal Analysis Under Data Inconsistency<br>Normalized sales metrics based on store operating years and handled irregular time data (e.g., holidays) using custom UDFs for accurate time-based comparison.<br>

#### 📚 What I Learned：
- Gained practical experience with Tableau, Python (pandas, matplotlib), and public dataset exploration.<br>
- Learned how to communicate data-driven findings clearly through dashboards and presentations.<br>
